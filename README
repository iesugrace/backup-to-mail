A tool to backup small files to mail server without exposing privacy.

Components:
    1. mutt         <-- mail agent
    2. msmtp        <-- smtp sender
    3. xz           <-- compress
    4. gpg          <-- encryption
    5. script       <-- the tool


INSTALL
    1. install the dependencies
        $ apt-get install xz-utils mutt msmtp gnupg getmail4

    2. run the script install.sh, and it will guide you through.
        $ ./install.sh


How to use
    The script install.sh installs two executable scripts
    to your PATH, they're b2e and fb, fb is a helper script
    that makes it simple to backup some pre-set files.

    The following command will pack the directory /path/to/dir,
    compress it, encrypt it, and then send it to the email
    address which you configured during the installation, email
    subject is "xx backup".

        $ tar cf - /path/to/dir | b2e -s "xx backup"

    When you want to backup many files at a time on a regular
    basis, fb may be a better choice, just open the fb script,
    edit it, put your file paths in it, and then run it:

        $ fb
